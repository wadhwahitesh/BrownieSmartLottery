1.  Users can enter lottery with ETH based on a USD Fee
2.  Admin will choose when the lottery is over(This makes it centralized, decentralized can be done by DAO or chainlink time checker stuff)
3.  The lottery will select a random winner

How do we test this:
1: 'mainnet-fork
2:'development' with mocks
